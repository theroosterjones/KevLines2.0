# KevLines 3.2 — On-Device Exercise Form Analysis & Movement Assessment

A fully local iOS app that analyzes exercise videos and movement screens, overlaying biomechanical feedback (joint angles, skeleton, rep counts, tempo phases, letter-graded postural assessments) in real time using the device camera or saved videos. No server, no cloud, no network dependency.

## Changelog

### v3.2.0 — Plane-aware Movement Assessments
- **Front/Back vs Side picker per assessment** — every movement assessment now ships in two camera-plane variants. The picker UI surfaces only the planes a given assessment supports, snaps the side picker on/off automatically (sagittal needs a side, frontal is bilateral), and rewrites both the camera-setup tip and low-tracking warning per plane.
- **Sagittal Squat Assessment** — strict 90° side profile of the working leg. Grades depth (hip→knee→ankle), exposes peak knee flexion as a clinically familiar number, and grades torso lean against a band rather than purely lower-is-better. Captures lean *at* the bottom (not the worst lean across the clip) so descent/ascent transients don't bias the score.
- **Frontal Hip Hinge Assessment** — bilateral rear-view hinge screen. Grades hip tilt, shoulder tilt, and worst-knee tracking deviation as a percentage of hip width. Sticky "high-side" labels (e.g. "L hip high 6.4°") so the summary names the asymmetric side, not just its magnitude.
- **Sagittal Shoulder Flexion** — single-arm side-profile ROM analyzer with automatic side fallback when the user accidentally films the wrong profile (driven by mean per-landmark visibility with hysteresis to prevent flapping).
- **3.2.2** — build version bump for App Store / TestFlight (`MARKETING_VERSION` 3.2.2, build 6).

### v3.0.0 — Assessments, HUD modes, Spine landmarks
- **Movement Assessments** — a new analysis category alongside Exercises. Implements `AssessmentAnalyzer` with letter-graded sub-metrics (A–F), a "weakest-link" overall grade, and a colored skeleton driven by per-frame grade with hysteresis to prevent flicker. Initial set: **Shoulder Flexion** (bilateral overhead ROM with asymmetry detection), **Squat Assessment** (rear-view depth + trunk lean + knee tracking), **Hip Hinge Assessment** (side-view depth + spine neutrality).
- **Simple / Full HUD overlay modes** — toggleable via the gauge button in Live and the picker in Saved Video. `HUDOverlayBuilder` adds a right-anchored column with a large rep counter, current consistency score (0–100), live in-progress tempo, and the last six reps' tempo history.
- **Per-rep metrics + consistency score** — `RepMetricsCollector` captures peak ROM angle and per-phase tempo durations for every completed rep, then derives a 0–100 score (60% ROM stddev, 40% tempo stddev). Outlier-gated against frames with a >30° single-step jump so one bad MediaPipe snap can't tank the score.
- **Spine overlay** — derived ear → shoulder → mid-thoracic → hip polyline drawn behind every analyzer's joint markers. MediaPipe ships no explicit spine landmarks; `SpineOverlay` interpolates one and uses a single canonical color (`OverlayColor.spine`) so spine lines are immediately readable across every screen.
- **Confidence-gated rep counting** — Squat / Deadlift / similar analyzers now gate rep counting, tempo classification, and peak-angle tracking behind a per-vertex visibility threshold (`minVertexVisibility = 0.5`). Low-confidence frames emit `.nan` for the angle so the metrics collector skips them, while overlay drawing falls back to the last trusted angle to avoid label flicker.
- **Live tracking-quality warning** — non-blocking yellow banner appears when 20+ consecutive frames return no usable pose, with exercise/assessment-specific repositioning hints.

### v2.3.0 — Exercise Library Expansion
- **Deadlift** (side view) — tracks hip angle (shoulder→hip→knee) as the primary rep driver with secondary knee angle; tempo tracking on the hip hinge.
- **Lunge** (side view) — tracks front knee angle with trunk lean shown in HUD to flag excessive forward lean.
- **Hip Hinge (Side)** — focused hinge pattern for RDL, good mornings, and KB deadlift drills; overlays a vertical plumb line through the hip as a hinge cue.
- **Hip Hinge (Back)** — bilateral assessment-style mode tracking hip tilt, shoulder tilt, and knee valgus/varus per side; no rep counting.
- **Overhead Press** (front or back view, bilateral) — tracks both elbow angles independently with average-driven rep counting; torso lean shown in HUD and highlighted red if >15°.

### v2.2.0 — Camera Switching
- **Front/back camera toggle** — tap the camera flip button in the live analysis top bar to switch between front and back camera at any time; mirroring is applied automatically for the front camera.

### v2.1.0 — Live Camera, 3D Angles, Adaptive Smoothing
- **Live camera mode** — real-time skeleton overlay via Metal (`MTKView` + `CVMetalTextureCache`), SwiftUI Canvas on top for joint labels; record and export the annotated video without leaving the app.
- **Two new exercises** — Elbow (Bicep/Tricep) and Shoulder Assessment.
- **Shoulder Assessment** — posterior-plane bilateral analysis measuring left/right shoulder elevation from true 3D world coordinates; uses hip level as a baseline reference.
- **3D world landmark angles** — all joint angle measurements now use MediaPipe's metric world coordinates (metres, y-up, hip-centred origin) via `result.worldLandmarks`; 2D screen coordinates are still used for overlay drawing only.
- **1€ adaptive smoothing** — replaced fixed-alpha EMA with the one-euro filter; cutoff frequency adapts to signal speed so the skeleton is smooth at rest and responsive during reps without retuning per exercise.
- **Exercise consolidation** — removed Back Squat and Hack Squat; kept a single generic Squat analyzer.

### v2.0.0 — On-Device Foundation
- Full port of the Python/Flask backend to a native iOS pipeline.
- Hardware-accelerated video I/O via `AVAssetReader` / `AVAssetWriter`.
- MediaPipe Pose Landmarker on-device (iOS SDK, GPU delegate).
- Tempo phase classification (eccentric / pause / concentric / pause) via angular velocity.
- Saved video analysis with annotated video export.

## Why 2.0 Exists

KevLines 1.x ([repository](https://github.com/theroosterjones/KevLines)) used a hybrid architecture: an iOS frontend uploaded videos to a Python/Flask backend on Render for MediaPipe processing, then downloaded the annotated result. This worked but had critical performance problems:

| Problem | Impact |
|---|---|
| Full video uploaded/downloaded over HTTPS | 2-5 min round trip on cellular |
| `cv2.VideoCapture` software decode on server | No hardware acceleration |
| MediaPipe CPU-only on server | Every frame CPU-bound |
| 5-codec fallback cascade per export | Unpredictable encode path |
| Second ffmpeg re-encode for color fidelity | Double processing time |
| Render free-tier cold starts | 30-60s delay before processing begins |
| No real-time capability | Can't process live camera feed |

**KevLines 2.0 eliminated all of these.** Everything runs on-device using Apple's hardware video pipeline and MediaPipe's iOS GPU delegate. The 3.x line builds on that foundation with assessments, HUD, and plane-aware analysis.

```

The same `OverlayInstruction` enum (`.line / .extendedLine / .circle / .text`) is consumed by both `OverlayRenderer` (Core Graphics, used for saved-video export and live recording) and `OverlayCanvas` (SwiftUI Canvas, used for live preview), so analyzers stay rendering-agnostic.

## Supported Exercises

Rep-counted analyzers driven by an angle-threshold state machine + tempo classification. All angle measurements use 3D world coordinates with a 2D fallback.

| Exercise | View | Tracked Joints | Rep Driver | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Squat | Side | Knee, Hip, Spine | Knee 100°/160° | Confidence-gated rep counting (vertex visibility ≥ 0.5) |
| Deadlift | Side | Hip, Knee, Spine | Hip 80°/160° | Same gating; secondary knee-angle readout |
| Lunge | Side | Front knee, Hip | Knee 100°/155° | Trunk-lean readout in HUD |
| Hip Hinge (Side) | Side | Hip, Knee | Hip 65°/155° | Vertical plumb line through hip as hinge cue |
| Hip Hinge (Back) | Rear | Hips, Shoulders, Knees | None (postural) | Bilateral tilt + valgus/varus screen |
| Barbell Row | Side | Elbow, Shoulder | Elbow 100°/150° | |
| Lat Pulldown | Side | Elbow, Shoulder | Elbow 90°/150° | |
| Overhead Press | Front/Back | Both elbows (bilateral) | Avg elbow | Torso lean flagged red if >15° |
| Elbow (Bicep/Tricep) | Side | Elbow | Elbow 60°/155° | Covers curl + extension |
| Shoulder Assessment | Front/Back | Shoulder girdle tilt | None (postural) | L/R shoulder elevation comparison |

---

## Movement Assessments

Letter-graded postural / movement screens with no rep counting. Each surfaces an overall grade plus per-metric sub-grades using a "weakest-link" model (overall grade = worst sub-grade). Each assessment ships in two camera-plane variants; the picker auto-hides the side selector for frontal-plane (bilateral) variants.

| Assessment | Frontal (Front/Back) | Sagittal (Side) |
|---|---|---|
| Shoulder Flexion | Bilateral overhead ROM, L/R asymmetry flag (>15° diff) | Single-arm ROM with auto side-fallback when the wrong profile is filmed |
| Squat Assessment | Depth (avg knee), Trunk Lean, Knee Tracking (% of hip width) | Depth + Knee Flexion + Torso Lean (graded vs. an expected band) |
| Hip Hinge Assessment | Hip Level, Shoulder Level, Knee Tracking (sticky high-side label) | Hinge Depth + Spine Neutrality (mid-spine deviation from ear-hip line) |

Coloring uses `OverlayColor.romQuality(grade:)` (green→red across A–F) and runs through `GradeHysteresis` (5-frame default) so the colored skeleton doesn't flicker between adjacent grades during live preview.

## Technical Details

### Live Camera (Metal)
`CameraService` wraps `AVCaptureSession` with `kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA` output, a 90° rotation for portrait orientation, and front-camera mirroring. `MetalCameraRenderer` converts each `CVPixelBuffer` to an `MTLTexture` via `CVMetalTextureCache` (zero-copy) and renders it as a textured full-screen quad. A `SwiftUI.Canvas` overlay draws the skeleton instructions in normalized coordinates on top. When recording, `OverlayRenderer` composites the overlay onto a cloned pixel buffer and writes it via `LiveVideoRecorder` (`AVAssetWriter`, `expectsMediaDataInRealTime = true`).

### 3D World Landmark Angles
`PoseLandmarkerService` extracts both `result.landmarks` (normalised 2D, for overlay drawing) and `result.worldLandmarks` (metric 3D, for angle calculations). `AngleCalculator.angle3D(a:b:c:)` computes the interior angle using `simd_normalize` + `simd_dot` + `acos` with a `[-1, 1]` clamp. Each analyzer tries world positions first and falls back to 2D screen positions if unavailable. `LandmarkSmoother` has independent `smooth()` (2D) and `smooth3D()` channels so overlay and angle smoothing don't interfere.

### 1€ Adaptive Filter
`LandmarkSmoother` is a 1€ filter. At rest the cutoff is `minCutoff = 1.0 Hz` (smooth). During movement the cutoff rises proportionally to `beta × |smoothed_speed|` (`beta = 0.5`), keeping the skeleton responsive during reps without jitter at lockout. The `timestamp` parameter accepts `landmarks.timestamp` (actual frame time) so the filter uses correct `dt` in both live and offline modes — without this, offline video processed faster than real time would give a near-zero alpha and freeze the filter.

### Plane-aware Assessment Routing
`AssessmentConfig.makeAnalyzer(side:plane:)` switches over a `(AssessmentType, ViewPlane)` tuple to instantiate the correct analyzer. Each assessment declares its `supportedPlanes` and `defaultPlane`; the picker UI in both `ExerciseView` and `LiveAnalysisView` only shows the segmented plane control when `supportedPlanes.count > 1`, snaps the plane back to the default on assessment change, and toggles the side selector on/off based on `requiresSideSelection(plane:)`. Camera-setup tips and low-tracking warnings are also plane-aware.

### Per-rep Metrics + Consistency Score
`RepMetricsCollector` consumes `(phase, angle, repCount, timestamp)` once per frame. When `repCount` increments, it finalizes the rep with peak flexion angle (gated against >30° single-step jumps so one bad frame can't poison ROM stats) and per-phase durations, then resets. The 0–100 score weighs ROM stddev (60%) and tempo stddev (40%) and is only emitted after at least 3 completed reps. `HUDOverlayBuilder` renders the score, the live in-progress tempo, and the last six completed reps as a scrolling history.

### Spine Polyline
MediaPipe doesn't ship spine landmarks. `SpineOverlay.instructions(ear:shoulder:hip:)` derives a four-point polyline (ear → shoulder → midpoint → hip), uses a single canonical color (`OverlayColor.spine`), and is drawn first by every analyzer so the limb skeleton and joint markers paint over it. Sagittal-plane assessments tint the spine with the lean / neutrality grade so spine quality is immediately legible.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 17.0+ deployment target
- Physical iPhone (Metal is required; the iOS Simulator does not support Metal rendering)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/theroosterjones/KevLines2.0.git
cd KevLines2.0

# Download the MediaPipe pose model
curl -L -o Sources/pose_landmarker_full.task \
  https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/pose_landmarker/pose_landmarker_full/float16/latest/pose_landmarker_full.task

# Generate the Xcode project (requires xcodegen: brew install xcodegen)
xcodegen generate

# Open in Xcode
open KevLines2.0.xcodeproj
```

The SPM dependency ([SwiftTasksVision](https://github.com/paescebu/SwiftTasksVision)) and model bundling are already configured in `project.yml`, including pre/post-build scripts that patch MediaPipe's framework `Info.plist` for App Store validation. Build, select your iPhone as the target, and run.

> **First launch:** the app will request camera access when you switch to Live Camera mode. Grant it in the system prompt or via Settings → Privacy → Camera.

## Adding a New Exercise

1. Create `Sources/Analysis/Analyzers/NewExerciseAnalyzer.swift` conforming to `ExerciseAnalyzer`.
2. Guard on 2D positions (needed for overlay), then fetch 3D world positions for angle calculation.
3. Use `AngleCalculator.angle3D()` with an `AngleCalculator.angle()` fallback.
4. Pass `timestamp: landmarks.timestamp` to every `smoother.smooth()` / `smoother.smooth3D()` call.
5. (Recommended) Apply confidence gating à la `SquatAnalyzer` — skip rep counting / tempo / peak tracking when `min(visibility...) < 0.5` and emit `.nan` for the angle so `RepMetricsCollector` excludes the frame.
6. Add the case to `ExerciseType`, then add an entry to `ExerciseConfig.all` in `Models/Exercise.swift` (+ camera tip + tracking warning copy).

## Adding a New Assessment

1. Create one analyzer per supported plane (`AssessmentAnalyzer`), e.g. `MyAssessment.swift` (frontal) and `MyAssessmentSagittal.swift` (sagittal).
2. Implement `currentMetrics()` returning sub-grades + an overall grade (use `LetterGrade.gradeLowerIsBetter` / `gradeHigherIsBetter`).
3. Wrap per-frame grading in `GradeHysteresis` so the colored skeleton stays stable.
4. Add the case to `AssessmentType`, then add an entry to `AssessmentConfig.all` declaring `supportedPlanes` + `defaultPlane`.
5. Wire the case into `AssessmentConfig.makeAnalyzer(side:plane:)`.
6. Add plane-aware copy to `AssessmentType.cameraSetupTip(for:)` and `lowTrackingWarning(for:)`.

No server changes, no API updates, no deployment.
